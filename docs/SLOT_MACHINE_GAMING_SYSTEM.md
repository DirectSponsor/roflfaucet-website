## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
/slots.html         # Main slot machine page
/slots.css          # Complete styling and animations
/slots.js           # Game engine and dual-mode logic
/images/bigwin*.png # Win celebration graphics
```

### API Integration

**Required Endpoints:**

```javascript
// Get current user balance and level
GET /api/user/balance
Response: {
  spendableBalance: number,
  level: number,
  lifetimeBalance: number
}

// Add credits with transaction tracking
POST /api/user/balance/add
Body: {
  amount: number,
  source: "gaming_temp" | "daily_gaming_bonus",
  description: string
}

// Deduct credits with transaction tracking  
POST /api/user/balance/subtract
Body: {
  amount: number,
  source: "gaming_temp",
  description: string
}
```

### Transaction System

**Gaming Transactions:**
- `gaming_temp`: Real-time wins/losses during gameplay
- `daily_gaming_bonus`: End-of-day net positive rollup

**Daily Rollup Process:**
1. Calculate net gaming gain/loss for each user
2. If net positive: Add to lifetime balance as `daily_gaming_bonus`
3. If net negative: No lifetime balance change
4. Clear all `gaming_temp` transactions

## User Experience Flow

### Anonymous Users
1. **Discover**: Land on slots page, see exciting demo gameplay
2. **Engage**: Play with 500 demo credits, experience wins
3. **Convert**: See login prompts after big wins
4. **Sign Up**: Create account to keep winnings

### Logged-In Users  
1. **Play**: Use real UselessCoins for gameplay
2. **Win**: Credits immediately added to spendable balance
3. **Progress**: Buy level upgrades for better multipliers
4. **Track**: Gaming activity separated from other earnings

## Economic Design

### Payout Structure
```javascript
Triple Matches:
🔴🔴🔴: 400x bet  // Jackpot
📊📊📊: 75x bet   // Triple BARs  
🍒🍒🍒: 35x bet   // Triple Cherries
🍌🍌🍌: 15x bet   // Triple Bananas
🍉🍉🍉: 12x bet   // Triple Watermelons
🍊🍊🍊: 10x bet   // Triple Oranges

Partial Matches:
🔴🍒_: 15x bet    // 7 + Cherry + Any
🍒🍒_: 8x bet     // Two Cherries + Any
🍒__: 5x bet      // One Cherry + Any
// ... additional partial matches
```

### Symbol Weights (Player-Favored)
- Cherry: 35% (most common, frequent small wins)
- Banana: 25% 
- Watermelon: 20%
- Orange: 15%
- Lucky 7: 3% (rare jackpot)
- BAR: 2% (rarest high value)

### Big Win System
- **Pool Building**: 10% of all bets contribute
- **Trigger Conditions**: Pool ≥ 1000 credits + 10+ spins + 2% random chance
- **Payout**: 80% of pool (keeps 20% for next big win)

## Configuration & Customization

### Symbol Configuration
```javascript
this.symbols = [
  { emoji: '🍒', name: 'cherry', value: 35, weight: 35 },
  // ... customize symbols, values, and weights
];
```

### Payout Adjustment
```javascript
this.payouts = {
  '🔴🔴🔴': 400,  // Adjust payout multipliers
  // ... modify winning combinations
};
```

### Level System Tuning
```javascript
this.levels = {
  1: { cost: 0, multiplier: 1.0, maxBet: 1 },
  // ... adjust costs and multipliers
};
```

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Validation
- All game logic runs client-side for performance
- Server validates all balance changes
- Transaction types prevent gaming system abuse

### Anti-Cheat Measures
- Real balance managed server-side
- Demo mode isolated from real balance
- API authentication required for real transactions

### Rate Limiting
- Consider implementing spin rate limits
- Monitor for unusual transaction patterns
- Validate bet amounts against user level

## Analytics & Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- **Conversion Rate**: Demo → Registered users
- **Engagement**: Average spins per session
- **Economics**: Win/loss ratios and pool dynamics
- **Progression**: Level advancement patterns

### Data Collection
```javascript
// Available statistics
this.totalSpins    // Total games played
this.totalWagered  // Total credits bet
this.totalWon      // Total credits won
this.bigWinPool    // Current jackpot size
```
